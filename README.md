I expect that the subject will be engaging and interactive, sharing knowledge to everyone about the more fastest way to solve the problem. I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how the application built and  improve efficiency, and solve complex problems. Learning how to manage data flow, ensure compatibility, and maintain security across integrated systems will be essential skills.

I also expect the subject to introduce me to the tools and technologies that professionals use in the field.I also want to get some basic skills that I can use in real projects. I want to learn more about APIs, I want to understand how APIs work together to create a smooth system.

I hope this subject will help me develop a problem-solving mindset. Even if I donâ€™t understand everything right away, I want to learn how to ask the right questions, break down complex issues, and explore different ways to solve them. Ill  probably look at real examples and learn some methods used in the industry.
